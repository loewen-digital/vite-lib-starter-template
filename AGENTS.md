# AGENTS.md — vite-lib-starter-template

Single instruction file for every coding agent working in this repository. Codex reads it directly; Claude Code reads it through `CLAUDE.md`, which only imports this file. Change rules here, never in `CLAUDE.md`.

Template repository for loewen-digital libraries. Everything here must be generic: no product code, no library-specific names beyond the placeholder `my-lib`.

## Stack (fixed)

- TypeScript strict, Vite library mode, ESM only. Never CommonJS, never a `require` export, never tsup.
- npm only. `package-lock.json` is committed. Never yarn or pnpm.
- Vitest for tests. Node 22 (`.nvmrc`).
- `exports` map with `types` and `import` per entry; `sideEffects: false`; `files` limited to `dist`.
- Zod for runtime schemas where a library needs them. No React, no framework code in the core; framework adapters live in `src/adapters/<framework>.ts` with their own subpath export.

## Definition of done

- `npm run check`, `npm test`, `npm run build` pass.
- Every public function has a test: happy path plus one failure case.
- README documents install, usage, and the exports map.
- Nothing in `dist/` is committed.

## Agent Loop

Two ways to be here; check `GITHUB_ACTIONS`.

- **Set:** you run unattended via `.github/workflows/agent.yml` as `claude[bot]`. Nobody answers questions. Follow **Issue** and **Review** below: branch, PR, never `main`.
- **Not set:** you are in a local session with Eddy (Claude Code or Codex). Work on `main` and push after every green validation (the commands in step 4) while the version in `package.json` is below 1.0; a branch only when Eddy asks for one. **Always**, **Changelog** and **Writing for humans** apply to you as well. The loop is not your topic: do not look for `ready` issues, do not report whether the loop runs, do not mention labels or the cockpit unless Eddy asks. Work as if the loop did not exist.

**Issue** (label `ready`):

1. Read the issue: `gh issue view <n> --json title,body,labels,comments`. If acceptance criteria are missing: comment the concrete question, add label `needs-human`, remove `ready`, stop.
2. Branch `claude/issue-<n>-<slug>` from the default branch. One issue, one branch, one PR.
3. Implement following the rules above. Acceptance criteria are binding; a solution proposed in the issue is not. Build what fits this project and its conventions, even where that differs from the proposal, and explain every difference in the PR under "Deviations from the issue". If the need does not belong in this project: comment why, label `needs-human`, remove `ready`, stop. If something is missing in one of our own libraries (fullstack, flatdb, sveltekit-ai-orchestrator, element-js, element-js-ssr-renderer, element-library): open an issue there (`gh issue create --repo <owner/lib>`) that states the need and the context here, with at most a non-binding proposal; add the smallest workaround marked `// UPSTREAM: <issue-url>`, keep going. Never wait for upstream.
4. `npm run check && npm test && npm run build` must pass. After three failed attempts: open a draft PR, label `needs-human`, stop.
5. Review your own diff: security, dead code, error handling, accessibility.
6. Open the PR (`gh pr create`) in the PR format below, with `Closes #<n>`. Do not post `@codex review`: Codex ignores comments from bots. Eddy requests the review.

**Review** (a review on a `claude/*` PR):

1. Read reviews and inline comments since the last commit (`gh pr view <n> --json reviews,comments`, `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<n>/comments`). Nothing to do: stop, no comment.
2. Fix every point or explain in the thread why not. Never dismiss a security finding.
3. Validation green, push, then one PR comment: `Review findings addressed in <short sha>.` The workflow requests the re-review. After three fix rounds on one PR: `needs-human`, stop.

**Always:**

- Size and safety: before implementing, judge the scope. If it needs more than one PR (several independent parts, more than ~15 files), create sub-issues with `gh issue create` (the first labelled `ready`, the rest unlabelled), attach each to the parent as a GitHub sub-issue, comment the list on the parent, and work only the first. Commit and push after the first meaningful step and keep pushing, so nothing is lost when the run hits its turn limit.
- Dependencies are GitHub relations, never prose. When an issue cannot be finished before another one is closed, set "blocked by"; when you split work, set sub-issues. Lines like "Blocked by: #3" or "depends on #6" in the text are not read by the cockpit. Ids via `gh issue view <n> --json id --jq .id` (add `--repo` for another repo), then:
  `gh api graphql -f query='mutation($a:ID!,$b:ID!){addBlockedBy(input:{issueId:$a,blockingIssueId:$b}){clientMutationId}}' -F a=<id of the waiting issue> -F b=<id of the blocker>`
  `gh api graphql -f query='mutation($a:ID!,$b:ID!){addSubIssue(input:{issueId:$a,subIssueId:$b}){clientMutationId}}' -F a=<id of the parent> -F b=<id of the sub-issue>`
  An upstream issue with a workaround in place is not a blocker; set "blocked by" only when the work truly cannot proceed.
- Memory of this repository: nothing survives a run except what is committed. Rules live in this file. Every change a user or a developer of this project would notice gets its lines in `CHANGELOG.md` (see **Changelog**), in the same commit. When you deviate from an issue or choose between options, write `docs/decisions/NNNN-<slug>.md` (next free number; `## Context`, `## Decision`, `## Consequences`; at most 20 lines) and link it from the changelog line. Do not keep status logs or decisions in this file.
- Never ask. Blocked means: comment the question with options, `needs-human`, stop.
- Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, ...). Never force-push. Never commit secrets.
- In the loop, Eddy merges, not the agent.
- In the loop, never create or modify files under `.github/workflows/`: the App token lacks the `workflows` scope and the push is rejected. Describe the needed workflow change in a `needs-human` issue instead and continue. Locally, Eddy's `gh` has the scope.

**Changelog** (`CHANGELOG.md`, newest first):

- `## Unreleased` on top, then one `## v<Version> · <YYYY-MM-DD> · <Title>` heading per release; the version in `package.json` is the topmost released one. The heading format is a contract: some apps show the file as release notes.
- Bullets are written for the people who use or build the project: what changed and why it matters, not which files moved. Keep the language the file already uses.
- A release moves the Unreleased lines under a new version heading and bumps `package.json`. The loop never releases; Eddy does. Where this file says otherwise for a repository (version bump per commit), that rule wins.

**Writing for humans** (issues, PRs, comments):

- Everything you write is read by one person who wants to decide in thirty seconds. Result first, decisions visible, details collapsed in `<details><summary>Details</summary>…</details>`. Never drop information; move it down.
- PR body, in this order, at most 15 lines outside `<details>`: one sentence on what changed and why; `## Deviations from the issue` (bullets, or "none"); `## Needs Eddy` (touched auth, payments, schema or secrets; new secrets; upstream issues filed; follow-ups; or "nothing"); `## Verified` (the commands that passed, one line). Design reasoning, what was tried and failed, and file-by-file notes go into `<details>` or the commit messages.
- Issues you create (sub-issues, upstream): at most 20 lines outside `<details>`: `## Goal` (one sentence), `## Context` (why, for whom, link to the source issue), `## Acceptance criteria` (checkboxes, behaviour only), `## Proposal (non-binding)` if you have one, `## Out of scope`.
- Comments: one sentence plus a sha or link. Reasoning, if needed, in `<details>`.
- Commit messages carry the detail: conventional subject, body says why.

## Review rules (Codex)

- Judge the PR against the linked issue's acceptance criteria and the rules in this file.
- Acceptance criteria are binding, the issue's proposed solution is not. A PR that copies the proposal where a solution matching this project's conventions would fit better is a finding. Deviations must be explained under "Deviations from the issue".
- Check the PR body against the diff: if `## Needs Eddy` omits a touched sensitive area, or a deviation from the issue is not listed, that is a finding.
- A change a user or developer would notice without lines under `## Unreleased` in `CHANGELOG.md` is a finding. A deviation listed in the PR without a file under `docs/decisions/` is a finding.
- Report security issues, correctness bugs, missing or tautological tests, and rule violations. Skip formatting and naming taste.
- Say explicitly if the PR touches auth, payments, schema, or secrets.
- Findings first, with file and line. No praise, no diff summary.
